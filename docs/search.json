    "text": "Construction\nConstruction of the Congolese Soldiers Memorial was initiated by former DRC President Joseph Kabila with the then Chief of Staff of the Congolese armed forces, General Didier Etumba, overseeing the project. The monument was designed by Dr. Van Ntoto of the Kinshasa-based Anko Design Corporation with Congolese monumental sculptor Christophe Meko Disengomoka physically creating the piece. The memorial was Disengomoka’s first time attempting military art in his 25-year career. He stated in an interview with the French media outlet Dépêches de Brazzaville that the monument was designed to honor the DRC’s “valiant soldiers, dead or alive.”\n\n  Description: Sculptor Christophe Meko Disengomoka working on one of the molds for the monument.

Source: Kosuba Awate’s Blog\n\nThe Mémorial du Soldat Congolais was erected in the FORESCOM roundabout in Kinshasa, near the FORESCOM tower. The Société Forestrière et Commercial du Congo (FORESCOM) was established in 1912 by Forminière, a holding company created by King Leopold II in 1906 to deflect attention from his personal rule and exploitation of the Congo, and managed mining and timber sites across the Congo. The tower was completed in 1946, becoming the first skyscraper in Leopoldville, now renamed Kinshasa, and immediately became the most sought after professional location in the city. The Danes and South Africans opened consular offices in the Forescom tower and the Israeli and Taiwanese embassies were located in the building. At the time of its construction, the tower was regarded as a point of pride for both Belgian colonists and colonial subjects alike, as it represented the success of the colony, as well as the Congo’s integration into global modernity. The authorities’ decision to place the memorial at the former seat of Beligan pride suggests an attempt to reclaim the culturally significant location from its history of colonialism. It is a physical reclamation of an area that facilitated continued European colonization and exploitation of the country’s mineral riches.\n\n\nRelevance Today\n\n  Description: Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi lays a wreath at the steps of the Congolese Soldiers Memorial during the annual commemoration in 2022.  Source: Top243 News\n\nAn annual commemoration of Congolese soldiers is held at the memorial on May 17, which marks the date the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) entered Kinshasa in 1997. The AFDL seized control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo–then known as Zaire–from dictator Mobutu Sese Seko after nearly 30 years of military rule. AFDL leader Laurent-Desire Kabila became President and changed the country’s name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and began transitioning it toward democracy, although progress has been mixed. Since the memorial’s inauguration in 2017, DRC Presidents Joseph Kabila and Felix Tshisekedi have presided over the celebration alongside high ranking officials in the Congolese army (FARDC).\n\n\nThe annual ceremony additionally serves as to publicly bolster the connection between the Congolese armed forces and the acting Congolese president, who serves as Supreme Commander of FARDC. The DRC’s eastern region–particularly in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu–has been continuously embroiled in conflict since the memorial’s inauguration with rebel groups, terrorist groups, and regional proxy actors. The federal government relies on the nation’s armed forces to combat these threats and secure the DRC’s citizens and sovereignty. Many of the armed groups have stated their intention–as evidenced by the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels–to overthrow President Tshisekedi and install new leadership in the country. This highly symbolic event demonstrates both the president’s appreciation and recognition of the armed forces while visibly showing the military’s loyalty to the regime.\n\n  Description: Officials in the Congolese army stand before the Congolese Soldiers Memorial during the 2022 ceremony. Source: Top243 News\n\n\n\nMotto and Significance\nThe motto of the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) is Ne jamais trahir le Congo (Never Betray the Congo). At the annual celebration at the memorial, the FARDC Chief of Staff opens the ceremony by repeating the motto and emphasizing soldiers duties and commitment to serving their country. The repetition of the motto at the ceremony raises larger questions about the Congolese military’s role in securing and protecting the DRC. Under President Mobutu, the military was weakened significantly and prone to factionalism and largely beholden to systems of corruption and patronage. During the First Congo War, the military was unable to respond to the ADFL and regional actors’ military advances due to high ranking FARDC officers actively selling government equipment for personal benefit. The motto serves as a stark reminder of the military’s past role in facilitating and allowing its sovereignty to end.\nSince Laurent-Desire Kabila took power in 1997, however, the military hasn’t lived up to its motto. Rebel and insurgent groups have been reintegrated into the military despite their stated intentions of overthrowing elected leaders. Military commanders have enriched themselves by controlling the mining trade and erecting roadblocks in the country’s eastern regions. The military itself is feared by significant portions of the population in the country’s war torn East due its complicity in war crimes and human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, looting, and sexual assaults. FARDC’s abuse has contributed to the worsening security situation and is responsible, in part, for the formation of many of the militias that operate in the country’s East.\n\n  Description: Members of the former CNDP rebel group march in North Kivu province in 2012.  Source: Enough Project\n\nThe continued usage of the motto and its symbolism in opening the ceremony is in many ways ironic. The Congolese army has historically betrayed the country and its people and continues such behavior to a lesser extent in the present. Its repetition is arguably more of a PR move than reflective of the reality in the DRC, despite the grandiose rhetoric and principles articulated by high ranking members of the military."

    "text": "Design Overview\nThe Mémorial du Soldat Congolais depicts three soldiers from various periods in Congolese history dating back to the 1880s–the Force Publique, the Forces Armées Zaïroises (ZAF), and the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC). This was intended to offer a tribute to soldiers in a historical line dating back to the time of the Belgian Congo. The soldiers are positioned on pedestals of various heights, with the earliest soldier depicted at the lowest height and the others ascending in chronological order.\n\n\nForce Publique\n\n Source: X\n\nThe Force Publique soldier, seen on the lowest of the three pedestals and dated 1885-1960, is depicted wearing khaki shorts, as required by the uniform of the time, with calf straps and a cartridge belt. He holds the rifle used during this period, the Mauser, and wears a fez on his head. Notably, the soldier stands in the “Present Arms” position, depicting the military discipline of Force Publique soldiers during the period of Belgian colonization.\nKing Leopold II established the Force Publique as a private army composed primarily of European officers. However, recruitment was shifted to local people in 1891 to economize the force. Soldiers and officers were expected to carry out nonmilitary duties until 1904, with soldiers building roads and government stations and officers serving as foremen, architects, engineers, hydrographers, census takers, and constables. However, their primary duty was to fight.\nWhen the Congo Free State transitioned to Belgian colonial rule, the Force Publique remained its military and police force. During the First World War, the Force Publique fought German forces in German East Africa, or modern Rwandan territory. Later, during the Second World War, the Force Publique supported Belgian forces, and in the Belgian Congo’s final days, the Force Publique bloodily suppressed mass demonstrations in support of Congolese self-determination, although many Congolese soldiers mutinied against their Belgian commanders in the days following Congo’s achievement of independence. Following these mutinies, the Force Publique was renamed the Armée Nationale Congolaise and its leadership was africanized.\n\n\nForces Armées Zaïroises\n\n Source: Congo Profound\n\nThe next soldier depicted is a member of the Forces Armées Zaïroises (FAZ), or the Zairian Armed Forces, shown in uniform with a beret and boots. He is shown marching, highlighting his pride and commitment to both the FAZ and his country. In his explanation of the FAZ soldier’s design, memorial designer Christophe Meko explained that the soldier appears “under the sign of the prosperous period of the Republic with great honor,” as “grandiosity has its place there with the images that remain to us of the FAZ soldiers on parade.” The soldier’s pride and confidence in his march exemplifies this honor and grandeur.\nDespite the pride and honor depicted by this soldier, the FAZ was a notably weak military force. Zaire’s president, Mobutu Sese Seko, kept the forces intentionally weak as a means of “coup-proofing” his government. Looting became increasingly common, as soldiers were both underpaid and paid irregularly. Many stole spare parts or basic equipment. This strategy later hurt Mobutu, as the FAZ did not have the training, equipment, or morale to successfully combat the invasion of Zaire in 1996 and the overthrow of the Mobutu regime.\n\n\nForces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo\n\n Source: Instagram\n\nThe final soldier depicted, and the only one depicted in action, is a member of the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo, or the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), which is the current army of the DRC. He is depicted crouched in a firing position because the FARDC has experienced the most conflict of the soldiers in Congolese history.\nThe FARDC has engaged in both international and internal conflicts, with the Second Congo War breaking out between the DRC and Rwanda in 1998. This war is referred to as the deadliest in human history since World War II. More recently, the FARDC has fought the March 23 Movement (M23), a militant group vying for territory and resources in the eastern Congo, which emerged in the 1990s and experienced a resurgence in the 2020s. M23 is primarily backed by Rwanda, although Rwanda has denied allegations that it supports the group.\nThe ongoing conflict with M23 has been devastating for civilians, and both the FARDC and M23, as well as other militant groups, have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians. The soldier depicted by this tier of the memorial is still actively engaged in serious conflict, and the ongoing conflict was cited as part of the motivation for the monument’s creation. It pays tribute to all soldiers in Congolese history, but the soldier on the highest pedestal represents the forces engaged in the ongoing conflict with M23. The two sides only recently agreed to a ceasefire."

    "text": "Reviews\nReviews posted on sites such as Google Maps and Tripadvisor agree that the monument itself is not spectacular, but it honors and commemorates a group inseparable from Congolese history. This memorial’s value does not stem from its design, but from the history that its design captures and recognizes.\n\n  Source: Google Maps\n\n\n  Source: Tripadvisor\n\n\n\nOur Thoughts\nWe found this memorial incredibly interesting. Although the DRC has been known by many names during its history, there is a clear sense of identity and history across these various names and governments dating back to the Congo Free State in the 1800s. Although not every soldier in Congolese history is captured, there is a clear lineage outlined by the three periods depicted and the conflicts and periods of history they represent.\nOne specific factor we were drawn to is the lack of recognition of atrocities committed by the various Congolese armed forces. While conducting research, every group was accused of human rights abuses, yet this memorial only focuses on the glory and bravery demonstrated by Congolese soldiers throughout history. However, this likely connects back to the memorial’s intent to pay tribute to the soldiers who defended their country, especially today. Considering the intensity of the conflict the DRC has recently endured, acknowledging wrongdoings would detract from the patriotism and commitment to country this monument seeks to inspire. Its focus is not on a specific conflict and the impact it had, but rather on the history of Congolese soldiers’ defense of their country.\nAlthough the memorial itself is not remarkable in its design, the attention to detail in the design of each soldier, connections to their history, and use of these details to evoke a sense of pride and honor for Congolese soldiers and Congolese history make this memorial remarkable."
