This memorial’s value does not stem from its design, but from the history that its design captures and recognizes.\n\n  Source: &lt;a href=“https://www.google.com/maps/place/M%C3%A9morial+du+Soldat+Congolais/@-4.3013676,15.306153,1501m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!3m7!1s0x1a6a33bc263f0c9b:0xc53926d692dc19a0!8m2!3d-4.301373!4d15.3087279!9m1!1b1!16s%2Fg%2F11h5v8sq_n?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyMy4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D target=”_blank” rel=“noopener noreferrer”&gt;Google Maps\n\n\n  Source: &lt;a href=“https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294187-d17654721-Reviews-Memorial_du_Soldat_Congolais-Kinshasa.html target=”_blank” rel=“noopener noreferrer”&gt;Tripadvisor\n\n\n\nOur Thoughts\nWe found this memorial incredibly interesting. Although the DRC has been known by many names during its history, there is a clear sense of identity and history across these various names and governments dating back to the Congo Free State in the 1800s. Although not every soldier in Congolese history is captured, there is a clear lineage outlined by the three periods depicted and the conflicts and periods of history they represent.\nOne specific factor we were drawn to is the lack of recognition of atrocities committed by the various Congolese armed forces. While conducting research, every group was accused of human rights abuses, yet this memorial only focuses on the glory and bravery demonstrated by Congolese soldiers throughout history. However, this likely connects back to the memorial’s intent to pay tribute to the soldiers who defended their country, especially today. Considering the intensity of the conflict the DRC has recently endured, acknowledging wrongdoings would detract from the patriotism and commitment to country this monument seeks to inspire. Its focus is not on a specific conflict and the impact it had, but rather on the history of Congolese soldiers’ defense of their country.\nAlthough the memorial itself is not remarkable in its design, the attention to detail in the design of each soldier, connections to their history, and use of these details to evoke a sense of pride and honor for Congolese soldiers and Congolese history make this memorial remarkable."

    "text": "Design Overview\nThe Mémorial du Soldat Congolais depicts three soldiers from various periods in Congolese history dating back to the 1880s–the Force Publique, the Forces Armées Zaïroises (ZAF), and the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC). This was intended to offer a tribute to soldiers in a historical line dating back to the time of the Belgian Congo. The soldiers are positioned on pedestals of various heights, with the earliest soldier depicted at the lowest height and the others ascending in chronological order.\n\n\nForce Publique\n\n Source: X\n\nThe Force Publique soldier, seen on the lowest of the three pedestals and dated 1885-1960, is depicted wearing khaki shorts, as required by the uniform of the time, with calf straps and a cartridge belt. He holds the rifle used during this period, the Mauser, and wears a fez on his head. Notably, the soldier stands in the “Present Arms” position, depicting the military discipline of Force Publique soldiers during the period of Belgian colonization.\nKing Leopold II established the Force Publique as a private army composed primarily of European officers. However, recruitment was shifted to local people in 1891 to economize the force. Soldiers and officers were expected to carry out nonmilitary duties until 1904, with soldiers building roads and government stations and officers serving as foremen, architects, engineers, hydrographers, census takers, and constables. However, their primary duty was to fight.\nWhen the Congo Free State transitioned to Belgian colonial rule, the Force Publique remained its military and police force. During the First World War, the Force Publique fought German forces in German East Africa, or modern Rwandan territory. Later, during the Second World War, the Force Publique supported Belgian forces, and in the Belgian Congo’s final days, the Force Publique bloodily suppressed mass demonstrations in support of Congolese self-determination, although many Congolese soldiers mutinied against their Belgian commanders in the days following Congo’s achievement of independence. Following these mutinies, the Force Publique was renamed the Armée Nationale Congolaise and its leadership was africanized.\n\n\nForces Armées Zaïroises\n\n Source: Congo Profound\n\nThe next soldier depicted is a member of the Forces Armées Zaïroises (FAZ), or the Zairian Armed Forces, shown in uniform with a beret and boots. He is shown marching, highlighting his pride and commitment to both the FAZ and his country. In his explanation of the FAZ soldier’s design, memorial designer Christophe Meko explained that the soldier appears “under the sign of the prosperous period of the Republic with great honor,” as “grandiosity has its place there with the images that remain to us of the FAZ soldiers on parade.” The soldier’s pride and confidence in his march exemplifies this honor and grandeur.\nDespite the pride and honor depicted by this soldier, the FAZ was a notably weak military force. Zaire’s president, Mobutu Sese Seko, kept the forces intentionally weak as a means of “coup-proofing” his government. Looting became increasingly common, as soldiers were both underpaid and paid irregularly. Many stole spare parts or basic equipment. This strategy later hurt Mobutu, as the FAZ did not have the training, equipment, or morale to successfully combat the invasion of Zaire in 1996 and the overthrow of the Mobutu regime.\n\n\nForces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo\n\n Source: Instagram\n\nThe final soldier depicted, and the only one depicted in action, is a member of the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo, or the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), which is the current army of the DRC. He is depicted crouched in a firing position because the FARDC has experienced the most conflict of the soldiers in Congolese history.\nThe FARDC has engaged in both international and internal conflicts, with the Second Congo War breaking out between the DRC and Rwanda in 1998. This war is referred to as the deadliest in human history since World War II. More recently, the FARDC has fought the March 23 Movement (M23), a militant group vying for territory and resources in the eastern Congo, which emerged in the 1990s and experienced a resurgence in the 2020s. M23 is primarily backed by Rwanda, although Rwanda has denied allegations that it supports the group.\nThe ongoing conflict with M23 has been devastating for civilians, and both the FARDC and M23, as well as other militant groups, have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians. The soldier depicted by this tier of the memorial is still actively engaged in serious conflict, and the ongoing conflict was cited as part of the motivation for the monument’s creation. It pays tribute to all soldiers in Congolese history, but the soldier on the highest pedestal represents the forces engaged in the ongoing conflict with M23. The two sides only recently agreed to a ceasefire."
